# Stock Prediction 

## Project Title: Stock Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains the code for a data science internship project focused on stock price prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The project aims to forecast the future price of a selected stock based on historical data.

### Project Overview:

In this project, we utilize LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, to analyze historical stock price data and make predictions about future prices. LSTM networks are particularly suitable for sequential data like time series due to their ability to retain long-term dependencies.
